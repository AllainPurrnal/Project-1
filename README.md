# FURR.
**Our goal in creating this application is to make a simple user interface to promote the adoption of pets from local shelters.  We plan on using the Petfinder.com API to grab data on pets up for adoption and the Google Maps API to simplify the visualization of the user in relation to their desired pet/shelter  Essentially, we plan taking inspiration from the idea of tinder and playing on the zeitgeist of fickleness and short attention spans.**

## Getting Started
